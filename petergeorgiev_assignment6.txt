
1. The table containing all the inmates of the Boone County Jail.

This is the table started with the following tag:

<tbody class="stripe" id="mrc_main_table">
              
2. The table containing all the passed legislation from the Missouri Legislature.

This is the table started with the following tag:

<table id="Table1" style="HEIGHT: 232px" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" width="100%" border="0">

3. The table containing all the minutes of the Columbia City Council.

In this case, I think the easiest way would be to grab the contents of the table started with the following tag:

<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" style="clear:both;"

Export them into a .csv file and then only take the minutes.

4. The element containing the mug shot of a detainee in the Boone County Jail.

<img alt="Mugshot of ACTON, ANTHONY SEAN" src="SH01 MP.I00620s?CNTYP=97824" title="ACTON, ANTHONY SEAN">

5. Modifying a request and response transaction.

We modify the year in the following request:

https://house.mo.gov/MemberGridCluster.aspx?category=county&county=Boone&year=2019&code=R

2019 should be substituted with 2005

https://house.mo.gov/MemberGridCluster.aspx?category=county&county=Boone&year=2005&code=R
